Description: An Android app that will allow users to manipulate a bassline tangibly by moving their phone in an up and down motion, whilst applying filters and other effects using touch-screen gestures.

The directory structure in use is as follows:
	
	prototypes - rapid prototyped designs, used to test code and implementations that will be of use in the project
	timesheets - contains a sub-directory for each member of the project team in which they can store their weekly timesheets
	trunk - the main code tree
