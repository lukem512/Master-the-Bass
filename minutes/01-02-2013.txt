Meeting Minutes

---------------

Guy and Petro have made good progress with the UI. There is still the Settings menu to do.

	- The 'Hold' gesture should not toggle, it should only enable as long as the gesture is being performed.

	- Play button on main screen needs to be implemented

	- To touch-bases with Ricky about the 'pretty UI'

	- Petro's phone to be main UI target for Beta release - assuming the audio works (to be tested ASAP)

Documentation needs updating, release Schedule and a report on work done + design decisions

Luke and Steve to plug in accelerometer directly to audio creation.

	- a 'quick fix' for the latency issues in Stop button could be to mute the phone

Jon to look into Echo and Reverb filters

	- to read Dr Dobbs website and implement an Envelope Generator (for volume)
